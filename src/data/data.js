          "My professional journey began as a Freelance Web Developer where I built a portfolio of responsive websites and applications for a diverse clientele. Each project presented its own set of challenges, from gathering requirements to developing custom solutions and managing everything from design to deployment. Working independently, I was responsible for ensuring that every project was delivered on time and within budget, which helped me develop strong project management skills.<br /><br />In 2020, I co-founded IM Creation as a technical director where I took on a leadership role in driving the technology strategy to meet clients' goals. My responsibilities went beyond coding; I managed a multidisciplinary team of designers, and tech professionals, ensuring that each project was executed seamlessly from concept to completion. I also introduced quality control processes that improved the overall standard of our web projects. This position allowed me to grow both as a leader and as a technical expert, as I was responsible for overseeing all aspects of project delivery.<br /><br />In September 2023, I embraced a new challenge at Ark-x Talent Factory as an Instructor and Software Developer. Here, I mentor aspiring developers, sharing my knowledge of programming and engineering to help them grow into skilled professionals. Beyond teaching, I am also responsible for creating engaging curriculum content tailored for our learning management system. My role includes designing custom software solutions to optimize the company's internal operations, ensuring that our team stays on track with project deliverables and making improvements where necessary. This experience has been incredibly rewarding, as I get to shape the next generation of developers while continuing to push the boundaries of my own capabilities.",

          "In March 2019, I embarked on my journey at 1337, the Moroccan branch of the 42 Network, after successfully surviving the infamous pool month. The early days were intense, filled with countless hours in front of a screen, as I tackled the intricacies of the C languageâ€”wrestling with memory management, mastering pointers, and diving deep into advanced algorithms. After conquering several projects in this realm, I shifted gears and ventured into graphics, creating visual magic with the minilibX library. As my skills sharpened, I transitioned into the web development branch, starting with PHP before embracing the dynamic world of the JavaScript stack. It was during the first internship project, however, that I made the difficult decision to leave the program and focus on my professional career. My time at 1337 may have been cut short, but it set the foundation for everything that followed.",
